# Material for the pre-conference workshop on Data visualization with R

The two HTML tutorial cover a very quick intro to R basics (filename: `R_basics_dplyr`) together with the `dplyr` package, and the full data visualization class (filename: `R_visualization`).

The other files are all the data files that we being used in the two tutorials.

I recommend to download everything and keep all the files in the samy folder.
